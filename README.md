# Fckng Fractals
## Windows app for creating simple fractals

FcnkgFractals is an app that allows user to create fractals such as binary tree, Koch's snowflake and mandelbrodt set.


## Features

- Binary tree (length of initial branch, scaling, angle could be modified)
- Koch's snowflake (still don't know)
- Mandelbrodt set (still don't know)

## Tech

Fckng Fractals uses only WPF .Net 6.0

## Installation
FckngFractals requires Visual Studio 2021 to run.
(My bad, I can not create exe files...)

## Future Updates
If I'm still in the mood, maybe another types of fractals will be added)))
